/*
   Global view overrides. These get generated in the db if set on logon. And used instead of the normal data view.
   Overrides must always show todays log entries, regardless of criteria.
   Overrides don't affect category and keywords desired searches and views. They are mainly useful to filter out 
   the not required to see on the main pages.
   NOTE - These settings AND on VW_LOG_WITH_EXCLUDES if they are set. VW_ prefix signifies, database view, 
   meaning this will be created. Based on the settings bellow you make. An interesting concept, don't you think?
