# Notes

ProgresSQL Server is an full database service solution. Handling interaction, like databases, users and backups.
These all can be handled outside the scope of the LifeLog application.
However, it is not required or recomended to have an fully managed database system, like this, 
just to use the LifeLog app.

Modify the following anon property tag in main.cnf to specify:
<<DBI_DRV_PRFIX<DBI:Pg:host=localhost>

The alias is by default assumed the database name, and the user.

Modify the following anon property, to have multiple users as aliases loging into same database.
<<DBI_MULTI_USER_DB<0>
to something like:
<<DBI_MULTI_USER_DB<lifelog>

Hope all works for you, and happy logging!
