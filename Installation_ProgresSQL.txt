#Notes

ProgresSQL Server is an full database service solution. So interaction, like databases, users and backups.
These are all handled outside the scope of the LifeLog application. You will need to set this up,
prior of using this application. And make an setting in main.cnf that this is handled outside.
Mainly what driver you are using. In this case it is the ProgresSQL one. Modify the Anon property to say:
<DBI_DRV_PRFIX<DBI:Pg:host=localhost;dbname=>
Don't specify the dbname. You don't need to run a schema, as on a new blank database, all will be created.
The alias is assumed the database name, and the user.

Hope all works for you, and happy logging!
